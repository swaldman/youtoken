# YouToken

This was my first "play" contact written in solidity and first test deployed to the blockchain in December 2015.

The basic idea is a contract that lets any ethereum address create its own token that its owner can issue
at will, and that its holders can redeem at will. The contract makes no suppositions about what issuance
and redemption might mean.

I don't know whether I'll ever further develop this. Right now I'm publishing it as an sbt-ethereum
example project. Again, this is basically my "hello world" contract, not (or at least not yet) a thing
that is intended to be useful.

This code has not been carefully audited. At all.
